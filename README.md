# STANKOVIC_Adrien_TP5_ST2TRD

The file named "TP5_Report_SA_ST2TRD" contains :
- the answers of the questions in Part 1
- the answer to the question in Part 2

For the part 3, the test files have been updated to do the test with my update of the updateQuality() function which I called new_updateQuality.

For the part 3 and 4, I use inheritance from the "Item" class in order to have methods for the specific items.

The part 3 and part 4 are done on the "GildedRose.cs" file and are situated after the updateQuality() function.

The tests on each update methods (updateQuality and new_updateQuality) are green and cover 100% of the code. I add tests for the "conjured" items.


## The commit named "initial commit Part 2" corresponds to the commit we had to do after Part 2 and before Part 3.
## The commit namred "Final commit" corresponds to my final commit on the project and the final version of the file "GildedRose.cs".
